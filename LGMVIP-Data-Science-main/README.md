Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data. Data scientists perform data analysis and preparation, and their findings inform high-level decisions in many organizations.


###  What is Data Science

Well, generally speaking, Data Science is not a certain or a single one realm, it’s like a combination of various disciplines that are focusing on analyzing data and finding the best solutions based on them. Initially, those tasks were held by math or statistics specialists, but then data-experts began to use machine learning and artificial intelligence, which added optimization and computer science as a method for analyzing data. This new approach turned out to be much faster and effective, and so extremely popular.

So all-in-all, the popularity of Data Science lies in the fact it encompasses the collection of large arrays of structured and unstructured data and their conversion into human-readable format, including visualization, work with statistics and analytical methods — machine and deep learning, probability analysis and predictive models, neural networks and their application for solving actual problems.

Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science — undoubtedly, these major terms are the most popular today. And although they are somehow related, they are not the same. So, before jumping into any of those realms, it is mandatory to feel the difference.

### About the Project


Big Data — work with huge amounts of often unstructured data. The specifics of the sphere are tools and systems capable of withstanding high loads.```
Data Science is the addition of meaning to arrays of data, visualization, collection of insights, and making decisions based on these data. The field specialists use some methods of machine learning and Big Data — cloud computing, tools for creating a virtual development environment and much more. Data Science’s tasks summed up well by this Venn diagram created by Drew Conway:

Artificial Intelligence is the realm focusing on the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. AI as a study dates back to 1936 when Alan Turing build first AI-powered machines. Despite quite a long history, today AI in most areas is not yet able to completely replace a human. And the competition of AI with humans in chess, and data encryption are two sides of the same coin.

Machine learning is a creating tool for extracting knowledge from data. In ML models can be trained on data independently or in stages: training with a teacher, that is, having human-prepared data or training without a teacher, working with spontaneous, noisy data.```
Deep learning is the creation of multi-layer neural networks in areas where more advanced or fast analysis is needed and traditional machine learning cannot cope. “Depth” provides more than one hidden layer of neurons in the network that conducts mathematical calculations.

# The project includes followeing things



```
- Collection Search for channels where you can collect data, and how to get it.
- Check. Validation, pruning anomalies that do not affect the result and confuse with further analysis.
- Analysis. The study of data, confirmation of assumptions, conclusions.
- Visualization. Presentation in a form that will be simple and understandable for perception by a person — in graphs, diagrams.
- Act. Making decisions based on the analyzed data, for example, about changing the marketing strategy, increasing the budget for any     activity of the company.
